# In this section, how CDCM can be used to model and simulate deterministic
# as well as non deterministic buldings are demonstrated. Initially examples
# would be shown for a single zone building. How each system of a building such
# as RC system, HVAC system, Occupancy system etc can be modeledwill also be
# demonstrated.
