    """A class representing a Function node.

    A Function has parents and children that are Variables. A Function
    essentially represents a function that takes as inputs the values of
    its parents and sets the values of its children. This action is
    carried out by overloading the `forward()` method.

    In functions, the order of the parents and the children is
    important. So, instead of using sets for parents and children,
    we are using tuples. This also means, the the parents and children
    of a function have to be specified when the function is made and
    they are immutable.

    Keyword Arguments:
    func -- A callable object with inputs and outputs that match the
            number and type of the parents and children of this node,
            respectively. For example, if this node has two parents
            `p1` and `p2` and one child `c`, then the function should be
            like this:
            ```
            def func(p1_value, p2_value, ...):
                # do some computations
                return c1_value, c2_value, ...
            ```
    parents -- The parents of the function. Here order matters.
    children -- The children of the function. Order matters.

    For the rest of the keyword arguments see `Node`.
